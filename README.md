## Routes

The tutorial in the gatsby's own documentation does a mighty good job in explaining how to set up a website, but before diving into the blog's structure, I decided to create my custom landing page with a loading screen and a spiffy navigation.

To get up and running, the website is meant to describe two routes.

| Route   | Page         |
| ------- | ------------ |
| ./      | Landing Page |
| ./blog/ | Blog         |

Inevitably, the website will grow in complexity, contemplating the pages generated through Gatsby on the basis of the markdown files, but also additional pages for other routes. With this regard I'd like to add a route describing a missing, 404 page, or one making up an about section. This however will be something added in the future, once I set up the blog and I managed to write a few articles.

## TODO

-   [ ] 404 Route

-   [ ] "About me" Route
