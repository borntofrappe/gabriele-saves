<h1>You Hacker</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Dev</strong> section, where I try my best to document the development of this very website.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">homepage for 11ty</a>, it is surprisingly easy to get up and started.</p>
<pre><code class="language-code">npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
</code></pre>
<p>I already had a <code>README.md</code> file in the root folder, so I didn't even need to run <code>echo '# Page header' &gt; README.md</code>. Although, I didn't know you could create <em>and</em> populate a file with that syntax.</p>
<pre><code class="language-code">eleventy
eleventy --serve
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. Visit <code>localhost:8080/README</code>, and the markdown is made available in the familiar DOM tree.</p>
