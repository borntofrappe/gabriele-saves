## countdown

I've decided to put a deadline on myself and the deploy of borntofrappe specifically.

- by 2020-05-04

- using 11ty as a static site generator

- deploying on netlify

I will have my website online.

With that in mind, here's what I need to reach that milestone.

### Pages

Take the demos in the components folder and create three pages:

1. landing page

2. blog

3. blog post(s)

The components make up for 80+% of these pages, so there's a great starting point there. It seems frivolous to continue creating demos to increase that percentage.

### 11ty config

Look at the source code and the syntax that different website share when using the 11ty static site generator; for instance:

1. [11ty starter blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/blob/master)

1. [education links](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/educationlinks.fyi/tree/master/src)

The [leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/leaderboard/) lists a series of website with prime performance and accessibility. There's likely no better place to start learning more about 11ty and its development.

### Migration

The migration from the playground repository to the one housing the website has focused on front-end code and standardizing the markup. I've created several node scripts and markdown document as well, however, and these have not migrated yet. I consider the effort excessive, but there is actually a lot of value in both sources. Especially with `.md` files, often for single demos, these can focus on the myriad of choices I made to create the different designs. The `1px` translation, for instance; these are elements difficult to explain in the larger scope of the website, and better understood in the dedicated folders.

### Update

With considerable effort, I've restructured the entire project with a **playground** folder, documented every component, section and even the style guide. I'm quite proud of the multiple demos, and even more so of the scripts creating the SVG illustrations for the two different sections.

Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to consider the scripts describing the config files for 11ty, and have to delay that job for tomorrow.

## learning-d3

Browsing the web, I came up with a few ideas for the repository describing data visualizations with the d3 library.

- create a box plot, highlighting different metrics of the input dataset. A perfect way to practice with `d3-scale`, and especially `scaleBand` to separate different box plots from one another. Props to [this article exploring the cost of JavaScript frameworks](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/) for inspiring the project, and [this page on data-to-viz.com](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html) for detailing more information on the type of visualization.

- highlight the seasonality of google trends for the word [turnip](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=turnip) over the last 90 days. The upwards trend is rapidly explained considering the success of a recent video game, but I still found it interesting to see how the search results spike on Sunday. Consider reviewing [this podcast episode](https://dataviztoday.com/shownotes/02) to conjure up different ways to study seasonality in data.
