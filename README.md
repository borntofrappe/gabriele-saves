After much considerations, I've decided to repurpose this repository as a public journal; a place where I jot down a line or two as I grow as a software developer.

I've been occupied building my website with Svelte, and the static site generator Sapper. I've learnt a lot about both technologies, but ultimately decided to nuke the existing structure to use Eleventy instead.

There are a few driving factors, but the most prominent one is that the website is, and will remain for a considerable time, a blog. To this end, I really don't need much beyond markdown and the ability to parse said markdown to HTML. 11ty is a prime candidate to solve this issue.
