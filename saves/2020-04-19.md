# Table of Contents

## gabriele-saves

I created a **saves** folder in which to store the different markdown files, and adjusted the script accordingly. Using `node script` now creates a table of contents for the `.md` files in the specific folder. I might actually change the name of the script to something more descriptive, so that `${name}.js` already describes the purpose of the file.

```bash
node prepend-toc
```

Perhaps overly descriptive, but quite faithful as to what it actually does. I've also changed the `h1` element to describe "Table of Contents" instead of "Index". Minor change, but in line with previous updates.
