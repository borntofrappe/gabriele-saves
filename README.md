After much considerations, I've decided to repurpose this repository as a public journal; a place where I jot down a line or two as I grow as a software developer.

### borntofrappe

I've been occupied building this website with Svelte, and the static site generator Sapper. I've learnt a lot about both technologies, but ultimately decided to nuke the existing structure to use Eleventy instead.

There are a few driving factors, but the most prominent one is that the website is, and will remain for a considerable time, a blog. To this end, I really don't need much beyond markdown and the ability to parse said markdown to HTML. 11ty is a prime candidate to solve this issue.

### borntofrappe.github.io

The last update I made to this website removed a banner I had included at the top of the page, announcing a big rewrite. I might have modified the color palette or updated the content as well, but it's fair to say that the development has been close to null. Since I plan to devote most of my time to the 11ty-powered website, I plan to take this page and make it into a website introducing myself, and where I spend most of my time (for instance codepen and twitter). It'd be neat to also add a timeline, a map of sorts charting the most important achievements/milestones (for instance the freecodecamp certifications).
