## Notes

In the **DEV** folder I describe the development of this very website, with a verbose markdown file and a series of smaller projects developing different parts of the application.

In this markdown file instead, I set out to schedule upcoming features, such as:

-   [ ] 404, missing page, for any path not matching a known route.

-   [ ] "About me" section, for the `/about` route.
