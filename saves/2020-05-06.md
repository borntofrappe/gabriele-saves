## borntofrappe

### ::selection

This is something I discovered rather randomly the other day: do not use custom properties when styling the color and background color of the text being selected. It seems Edge doesn't interpolate the color, and completely hides the selection.

### Components

I've reviewed the entire folder to finally make some progress with the website. Most of the demos required minor tweaks, but after testing the solution on Chrome, Firefox and Edge, I think they provide a solid foundation for the next stage: pages.

The markdown documents have also been updated to highlight the salient points of each showcase.
